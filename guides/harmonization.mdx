The **Harmonization Engine** is the core of the SuperSeeded platform. It uses a "Growth Equivalent" logic to resolve raw text labels into structured biological concepts.

## The Problem

Legacy systems rely on exact string matching. This breaks the supply chain because:

* **Units differ:** Litres (Volume) vs. Millimeters (Diameter).
* **Formats differ:** "Pot", "Bag", "Tubestock", "Planter Bag".
* **Abbreviations are rampant:** "AS" (Air Slot), "RP" (Root Pruning), "XG" (Ex-Ground).

## The Solution: Growth Equivalents

When you send a list of strings to `/resolve/specs`, our engine maps them to a **Stage of Maturity** (0-5). This allows you to programmatically determine if two items are swappable.

### The Maturity Hierarchy

| Stage | Name | Examples | Substitution Logic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | **Genetic** | Seeds, Tissue Culture | Not a plant yet. |
| **1** | **Propagation** | Jiffy, Plugs, Cuttings | Production inputs. High transplant risk. |
| **2** | **Liners** | Tubes, Cell Trays, Punnets | Stackable freight. "Potting up" stock. |
| **3** | **Retail** | 140mm - 300mm Pots | Standard rigid containers. Pallet freight. |
| **4** | **Advanced** | 45L Bags, Air Pots | Landscape construction stock. |
| **5** | **Mature** | Ex-Ground, 100L+ | Heavy machinery required. |

## Data Enrichment

Beyond simple categorization, the API returns critical metadata for logistics and risk management.

### 1. Logistical Intelligence

We explicitly flag freight constraints.

> **Scenario:** A `"Standard Tube"` is flagged as `is_stackable: true`. A `"200mm Pot"` is `is_stackable: false`.
> **Value:** Your application can automatically calculate that shipping 1,000 tubes is cheap (one pallet space), while shipping 1,000 pots is expensive (multiple pallets).

### 2. Quality & Risk Profiles

We tell you what to look for.

> **Scenario:** You resolve a `"Bare Root"` tree.
> **Response:** The API returns `transplant_shock_risk: "High"` and `seasonal_restriction: "Winter Only"`.
> **Value:** You can display a warning in your UI: *"Warning: This item is highly perishable and only available in Winter."*

## Example Request

```javascript
const response = await client.post('/resolve/specs', {
  items: [
    "400mm AS",       // Messy abbreviation
    "20L Planter Bag" // Specific format
  ]
});
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "input_label": "400mm AS",
      "match_confidence": "High",
      "standard_data": {
        "type": "Pot - Air Pruning",
        "stage_name": "Advanced Production",
        "stage_order": 4,
        "logistics": {
          "tier": "Pallet",
          "is_stackable": false
        },
        "quality_profile": {
          "transplant_shock_risk": "Very Low",
          "customer_note": "Superior root structure; requires more frequent watering until planted."
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
