title: Species distribution modeling
description: Understanding how climate change affects plant habitat suitability

## Overview

Species distribution modeling (SDM) predicts where plants can survive under different climate conditions. The API uses MaxEnt algorithms with CHELSA climate data to generate distribution maps for current and future scenarios.

## How it works

The modeling process combines species occurrence records with environmental variables to predict habitat suitability. The system downloads occurrence data from GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), processes climate data at 1-kilometer resolution, and generates suitability maps using maximum entropy modeling.

### Data sources

The API uses two primary data sources:

**Species occurrence records**: Downloaded from GBIF, these are GPS coordinates where the species has been observed. The system requires at least 30 occurrence points for MaxEnt modeling. Species with fewer records use simplified niche modeling.

**Climate data**: CHELSA version 2.1 provides 19 bioclimatic variables at 1-kilometer resolution. The API uses bio01 (annual mean temperature) as the primary variable, with data available for historical baseline (1981-2010) and future projections.

### Climate scenarios

Future projections use CMIP6 climate models with four emission scenarios:

- **SSP1-2.6**: Low emissions scenario with strong mitigation
- **SSP2-4.5**: Intermediate emissions scenario
- **SSP3-7.0**: High emissions scenario with limited mitigation
- **SSP5-8.5**: Very high emissions scenario without mitigation

Each scenario projects to three time periods: 2011-2040 (near future), 2041-2070 (mid-century), and 2071-2100 (late century).

## Output types

The API generates four visualization types:

### Suitability change map

Shows areas of habitat gain, loss, and stability between current and future climates. Green indicates stable suitable habitat, red shows habitat loss, blue represents new suitable areas, and gray marks consistently unsuitable regions.

### Current gradient map

Displays current climate suitability using a gradient from low (light) to high (dark) suitability. Occurrence points appear as red dots overlaid on the suitability surface.

### Future gradient map

Shows predicted suitability for the selected future period and scenario using the same gradient scale as the current map.

### Trajectory streamplot

Visualizes habitat shift patterns using streamlines. The flow field shows the direction and magnitude of suitable habitat movement over time. Darker streamlines indicate stronger directional shifts.

## Use cases

SDM supports several conservation and planning applications:

**Conservation planning**: Identify climate refugia where species are likely to persist. These stable areas become priorities for habitat protection.

**Restoration site selection**: Locate areas that will become suitable in the future. These sites are candidates for assisted migration or pre-emptive planting.

**Risk assessment**: Evaluate vulnerability of existing plantings to climate change. Areas showing habitat loss require adaptation strategies.

**Species selection**: Choose climate-resilient species for landscaping projects. Species with expanding suitable habitat are better long-term choices.

## Limitations

Several factors affect model accuracy:

**Data quality**: Models depend on occurrence record quality and completeness. Species with limited observations or biased sampling produce less reliable predictions.

**Climate variables**: Using only temperature (bio01) simplifies complex ecological relationships. Full implementations should incorporate precipitation, soil, and topographic variables.

**Dispersal capacity**: Models assume species can reach all suitable habitat. Natural dispersal limitations and barriers are not considered.

**Biotic interactions**: Competition, pollination, and other species interactions are not modeled. These factors can prevent establishment in otherwise suitable habitat.

## API workflow

The typical workflow involves three steps:

1. Submit a modeling request with species name and climate scenario
2. Poll the status endpoint until processing completes (typically 2-4 minutes)
3. Download the generated visualizations

Processing time depends on data availability and species complexity. Species with extensive occurrence records or complex distributions require more computation.

## Best practices

For reliable results:

- Use full scientific names including genus and species
- Select climate models appropriate for your region (MPI-ESM1-2-HR performs well globally)
- Consider multiple scenarios to bracket uncertainty
- Validate results against local knowledge and field observations
- Combine SDM outputs with other decision factors
