## What is the Platform Integration?

The SuperSeeded Platform API is designed for **Inventory Management Systems** and **Plant Marketplaces**. It allows you to embed a "Drag-and-Drop" digitization tool directly into your own dashboard.

Instead of forcing your suppliers to manually type orders from PDF quotes into your system, they can simply drag a file onto your interface. Our AI engine parses the messy document and returns enriched data ready for your platform.

    Suppliers can digitize a 500-line PDF quote in seconds, removing the biggest barrier to using your platform.

    The upload experience lives entirely on your domain. Your users never leave your dashboard.

## How it Works (The "Handshake")

To ensure security and accurate billing, we use a **Delegated Upload** model. This keeps your server lightweight—you don't handle the heavy file uploads; you just authorize them.



<Steps>
  <Step title="The Handshake">
    Your backend calls our API to say: *"I have a user (Nursery A) who wants to upload a file."* We give you a secure, temporary **Upload Token**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Handoff">
    Your frontend uses this token to upload the document directly to our secure processing cloud.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Result">
    We process the file using AI, structure the data, and send a webhook back to your server with the clean order details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why integrate?

* **Stickiness:** Customers who upload their order history into your platform are less likely to leave.
* **Revenue Share:** Our usage-based billing model allows you to resell this functionality to your users at a margin.
