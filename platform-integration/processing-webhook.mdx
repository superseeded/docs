title: "Processing Webhook (Deprecated)"
description: "Legacy internal webhook - superseded by frontend-initiated processing"
---

<Warning>
  **This internal webhook flow has been superseded.** 
  
  The new integration flow uses the [Resolve Specs from Upload](/platform-integration/tus-webhook) endpoint, which your frontend calls directly after upload completion.
</Warning>

## Migration

The processing flow has changed from automatic webhook delivery to frontend-initiated API calls:

| Old Flow | New Flow |
|----------|----------|
| Upload completes → Webhook fires automatically | Upload completes → Frontend calls API |
| Platform receives webhook callback | Frontend receives direct API response |
| Required webhook endpoint setup | No webhook infrastructure needed |

## New Flow

See [Resolve Specs from Upload](/platform-integration/tus-webhook) for the current processing endpoint documentation.

The new endpoint `POST /v1/resolve/specs/from-upload` accepts the same delegation token used for upload, providing a simpler, more predictable integration pattern.
