Nursery inventory data is inconsistent. One grower sells a `"400mm AS"`, another lists a `"45L Air Pot"`, and a landscape architect specifies a `"Rocket Pot"`. To a computer, these are three different products. To a horticulturist, they are the same biological asset.

We provide an API that harmonizes unstructured nursery stock labels into standardized, structured profiles. This engine allows you to match supply and demand based on biological reality rather than text strings.

## Core Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={1}>

## Why use this API?

* **For Marketplaces:** Enable matching so a buyer searching for a **20L Pot** can find valid substitutes like a **20L Bag**.
* **For Inventory Systems:** Clean up data imported from disparate supplier spreadsheets.
* **For Logistics:** Calculate freight estimates by identifying which items are stackable tubes or palletized 300mm pots.
