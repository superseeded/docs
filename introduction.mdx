title: "Welcome to SuperSeeded API"
description: "API for planting and procurement"

Nursery inventory data is inconsistent. One grower sells a `"400mm AS"`, another lists a `"45L Air Pot"`, and a landscape architect specifies a `"Rocket Pot"`. To a computer, these are three different products. To a horticulturist, they are the same biological asset.

The SuperSeeded API matches supply and demand based on biological reality rather than text strings. It includes components for spec alignment and platform integration.

## Why use this API?

* **For Marketplaces:** Enable matching so a buyer searching for a **20L Pot** can find valid substitutes like a **20L Bag**.
* **For Inventory Systems:** Clean up data imported from disparate supplier spreadsheets.
* **For Logistics:** Calculate freight estimates by identifying which items are stackable tubes or palletized 300mm pots.
* **For Platforms:** Offer AI-powered document processing to your merchants without building it yourself.
