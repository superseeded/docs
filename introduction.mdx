Nursery inventory data is notoriously messy. One grower sells a `"400mm AS"`, another lists a `"45L Air Pot"`, and a landscape architect specifies a `"Rocket Pot"`. To a computer, these are three different products. To a horticulturist, they are the same biological asset.

We provide a developer-first API that harmonizes unstructured nursery stock labels into standardized, structured profiles. Whether you are building a marketplace, an inventory system, or a quoting tool, our engine allows you to match supply and demand based on *biological reality*, not just text strings.

## Core Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="Spec Harmonization" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/guides/harmonization">
Resolve messy inputs (like "200mm pot" or "P14") into standardized **Growth Equivalent** stages. We enrich your data with logistical tiers, stackability flags, and quality inspection profiles.

## Why use this API?

* **For Marketplaces:** Enable "fuzzy matching" so a buyer searching for a **20L Pot** can find valid substitutes like a **20L Bag**, preventing zero-result searches.
* **For Inventory Systems:** Automatically clean up data imported from disparate supplier spreadsheets.
* **For Logistics:** Instantly calculate freight estimates by knowing which items are "Stackable" (Tubes) vs "Palletized" (300mm Pots).
