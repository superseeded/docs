## Authentication

The SuperSeeded API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can manage your API keys in the [SuperSeeded Dashboard](https://superseeded.ai/settings/api-keys).

### Obtaining an API key

1.  Log in to your account at [superseeded.ai](https://superseeded.ai).
2.  Navigate to Settings > API Keys.
3.  Click Create API Key.
4.  Configure your key settings:
    * Name: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Backend", "Dev Environment").
    * Credit limit (optional): Set a maximum usage limit (leave blank for unlimited).
    * Reset frequency: Choose how often the limit resets (e.g., Monthly, Never).
    * Expiration: Set an expiry date if required.
5.  Copy the generated key immediately. You will not be able to see it again.

### Using your API key

Your API key must be included in the header of every request (excluding the health check endpoint).

```bash
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Example request:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.superseeded.ai/v1/resolve/specs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk-ss-v1*****************************************" \
  -d '{
    "items": ["400mm AS", "20L Bag"]
  }'
```

<Warning>
**Security notice:** Your API keys carry many privileges. Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or client-side code.
