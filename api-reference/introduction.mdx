## Welcome to the SuperSeeded API

The SuperSeeded API provides programmatic access to our **Spec Harmonization Engine**, allowing you to integrate intelligent plant specification parsing and matching directly into your applications.

Whether you are building a marketplace, an inventory system, or a design tool, this API enables you to convert messy, unstructured nursery data into standardized, biological concepts.

## Authentication

The SuperSeeded API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [SuperSeeded Dashboard](https://superseeded.ai/settings/api-keys).

### Obtaining an API Key

1.  Log in to your account at **[superseeded.ai](https://superseeded.ai)**.
2.  Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**.
3.  Click **Create API Key**.
4.  Configure your key settings:
    * **Name:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Backend", "Dev Environment").
    * **Credit Limit (Optional):** Set a maximum usage limit (leave blank for unlimited).
    * **Reset Frequency:** Choose how often the limit resets (e.g., Monthly, Never).
    * **Expiration:** Set an expiry date if required.
5.  Copy the generated key immediately. You will not be able to see it again.

### Using your API Key

Your API key must be included in the header of every request (excluding the health check endpoint).

```bash
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY

```

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.superseeded.ai/v1/resolve/specs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk-ss-v1*****************************************" \
  -d '{
    "items": ["400mm AS", "20L Bag"]
  }'

```

<Warning>
**Security Notice:** Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
</Warning>
